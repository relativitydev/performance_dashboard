DowngradeEDDSPerformance.sql
* Removes RoundhousE tables

DropEDDSResourceTables.sql
* Drops tables in EDDSResource created by Backup/DBCC monitor procedure

InsertTestRatings.sql
* Used to populate QoS tables with dummy data
* Need to set parameter values before running (server/workspace IDs)
* The scores defined in the configuration section will be used to generate the ratings
* You can uncomment the truncate statements at the top to clear the QoS tables

InsertTestAudits.sql
* Used to insert dummy edit audits into a given workspace
* Need to change the use statement at the top to the intended workspace
* Allows user-defined number of hours to audit

CheckVarscatExists.sql
* Runs against all workspace databases on the current server
* Returns whether or not VARSCAT and Bullfrog are installed on each workspace

CheckRHScriptRunErrors.sql
* Runs against all databases on the current server
* Return any errors in RHScriptsRunErrors. Change the cutoff date to exclude old stuff.

SampleDataGenerator.sql
* Destroys some existing data and creates new test data.
* Disables automatic Looking Glass calls until another script is run.
* You can set the start time, the number of days to generate, and a seed for arrival rate.
* To append onto an existing test data set, change @clearDate to 0 and change the date.

7DayQoSDataScenarios.sql
* Provides various scenarios for testing the weekly sample - run only the scenario you want.
* Run SampleDataGenerator first!

GenerateRatingsFromSampleData.sql
* Calls BuildandRateSample to populate SampleHistory and Ratings
* Run SampleDataGenerator first, then a scenario in 7DayQoSDataScenarios, then this script.

EnableAutomaticLookingGlassCalls.sql
* Reenables automatic Looking Glass calls via the agent if they've been disabled.

VerifyQuarterlyWeeklyScores.sql
* Contains various queries that are useful in verifying score calculations.

ResetQoSExtendedProperty.sql
